      <p class="margin-bottom-20" style="color:#FFF">Flexwarm<sup>®</sup> technology is unlike any heating technology on earth. Over the last 5 years, our team has been researching and developing patented new technologies that have enabled us to create a completely unique flexible heating element that is so thin (0.5mm) it can be printed directly onto fabric.</p>
      <p class="margin-bottom-20" style="color:#FFF">Because Flexwarm<sup>®</sup> can be printed, it can then be layered directly onto fabric which enables <a href="http://8k.sdyea.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Heated Jackets</a> to be ultra-lightweight, durable and washable (without the need for adding additional heavy and bulky insulation materials).</p>
      <p class="margin-bottom-20" style="color:#FFF">We believe our technology is the future of smart wearables and has allowed us to create exquisitely designed and crafted outer wear that removes any barriers to the great outdoors – keeping you warm in any environment.</p>
